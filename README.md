# lappland-theme

This is essentially a fork, with subsequent local customizations, of
the [DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3] theme for [Pelican], a static site
generator written in Python. It used to be the repository of the theme
used for [lappland.io].

The [original developer](http://github.com/DandyDev) of the
pelican-bootstrap3 theme discontinued maintenance of it in early 2015,
and subsequently donated the theme to the [Pelican themes repository].
I have meanwhile upgraded the theme powering the lappland.io website to
the latest version of [pelican-bootstrap3], with a few [customizations
kept in a fork](https://github.com/hlapp/lappland-themes/tree/lappland-theme/pelican-bootstrap3).
